# RWTH_Aachen_2023-11-20
This repository contains the code and data required to perfom the regression models presented by Hanna Mahler at RWTH Aachen on November 20th, 2023 (as well as the slides).

Files included:

- R Markdown "GECCO_Verbs_regression": This script reproduces the regression model for all verb phrases. The script includes prior selection, model fitting, and model assessment.
- R Markdown "GECCO_Verbs_nonfinite_regression": This script reproduces the regression model for non-finite verb phrases. The script includes prior selection, model fitting, and model assessment.
- R Markdown "GECCO_Verbs_visualisations": This script reproduces the diagrams for verb phrases shown in the presentation (as well as additional visualisations).
- R Markdown "GECCO_Verbs_nonfinite_visualisations": This script reproduces the diagrams for non-finite verb phrases shown in the presentation (as well as additional visualisations).
- Excel spreadsheet "Overview_texts_vp": This spreadsheet contains the measurements on the level of the individual texts in the GECCo corpus.
- Excel spreadsheet "Overview_registers_vp": This spreadsheet contains the measurements on the level of register.
- Excel spreadsheet "vp_EO": This spreadsheet contains the annotated data extracted from the English part of the corpus.
- Excel spreadsheet "vp_GO": This spreadsheet contains the annotated data extracted from the German part of the corpus.
- Folder "Models" with rds-files: This folder contains the regression models that are produced in the "GECCo_Verbs_regression" and "GECCo_Verbs_non-finite_regression" script as rds-objects. If fitting the models takes too long they can be loaded directly from this folder.
- PDF with the slides of my presentation.
